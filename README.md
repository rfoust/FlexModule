# FlexModule
Powershell module for FlexRadio 6000 model amateur radios
FlexRadio Systems does not support this module, please do not contact them for support regarding FlexModule.
This module might blow up your computer or brick your FlexRadio 6000 series radio. Use at your own risk, and if anything happens, you assume the risk and responsiblity.

This Powershell module is still under development (and experimentation). If you don't know what this is or why you would want to install it, then it probably isn't for you.

To install -- Clone this repo to an appropriate Modules folder in Powershell, for example, in your Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\FlexModule folder.

If you're running a recent version of Powershell, just run get-flexradio and it should show your FlexRadio 6000 series radio.  Run connect-flexradio to connect to it.  Other get/set functions are available and are in various states of development. Some work, some don't.

If you have questions, feel free to ask (rfoust at gmail.com). If you are interested in a feature that I haven't implemented yet, let me know and I'll probably make it a priority. This is a "proof-of-concept" and "for-fun" project.

Enjoy!
